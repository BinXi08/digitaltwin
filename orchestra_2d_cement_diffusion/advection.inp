@Class: water_flow()
This object contains the general part of convection and defines the 
amount of water transported between cell 1 and cell 2.
It should be used in convection.inp before the component specific objects.

@Class: advec (name) 
This object contains the component specific part of convection and defines the 
amount of component (mol/s) transported between cell 1 and cell 2.
